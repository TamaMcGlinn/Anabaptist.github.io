It is our hope you would come and get to know Jesus Christ through His teachings, and to share in fellowship with His followers there.</p><h2 id=500-year-anniversary-of-anabaptism-in-europe>500 year anniversary of Anabaptism in Europe</h2><p>On January 21, 1525, in Felix Manz&rsquo;s house in Zurich, George Blaurock, Conrad Grebel and others were deep in earnest prayer with him - they had been informed by the Catholic community that their insistence on a biblical church life was considered heresy and would not be tolerated. These radical Bible-believing christians had for some time been encouraging each other to please God, rather than men, and now pondered the possibility of the sentence of death on the one hand, and the eternal fire of damnation on the other, if they violated God&rsquo;s laws. Rising from this prayer, George Blaurock asked Conrad Grebel to baptize him according to his profession of faith in Christ. After this, Blaurock baptized the other attendees. This first &ldquo;Anabaptism&rdquo; (&ldquo;rebaptism&rdquo;, as the Catholics have called it, because they regard infant baptism as the first baptism) marked the start of a revival of Christian faith in Europe that lasted hundreds of years; preaching took place under bridges and in forests and in villages, and many people were reached in a short time, despite the danger from worldly authorities.</p><p>In remembrance of the sacrifice of the Christian martyrs in Europe, the Conservative Mennonites of England, Denmark, Canada and the USA
are organising an Anabaptist Conference, 21-23 January, in Switzerland. It is about 10 hours from Amsterdam, either by train or by car.
<a href=/pdf/Anabaptist_Conference2025_switzerland.pdf>Read the the program/invitation here.</a></p><p>Today we see the result; a diaspora of small anabaptist communities who have at various points in history chosen to move and establish communities in distant lands, both to escape persecution at home, and to spread the gospel message to new countries. Today Jesus&rsquo; message is still the same; obey God, love His commandments, come out and be separate from the world, love one another. Today the call is still the same; each generation must be reached by Christ&rsquo;s message. But today Christian missionaries are needed in the very countries their ancestors came from.</p><h2 id=december-bible-conference>December Bible Conference</h2><p>Every first weekend in December, the Shropshire Hills Mennonite Church centred around <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Shrewsbury,+UK/@52.6587687,-2.7137306,10z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x486f7655f4dc15c3:0x6ed7820778d6cdc4!8m2!3d52.7073029!4d-2.7553268!16zL20vMDIzNW45?hl=en&entry=ttu">Shrewsbury (UK)</a> hosts a conference that usually draws around 200 people, being about half Nationwide Mennonites affiliated with their church, from the United States, and the other half being mostly mainland European believers.
