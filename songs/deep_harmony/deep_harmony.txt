Sweet is the work, my God, my King, to praise Thy name, give thanks, and sing, to show Thy love by morning light, and talk of all Thy truth at night. My heart shall triumph in the Lord, and bless His works, and bless His word; Thy works of grace, how bright they shine! How deep Thy counsels, how divine! Then shall I see, and hear, and know all I desir'd, or wish'd below; and ev'ry pow'r find sweet employ in that eternal world of joy.
