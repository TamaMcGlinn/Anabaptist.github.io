I need Thee ev'ry hour, most gracious Lord; no tender voice like Thine can peace afford. I need Thee, O I need Thee; every hour I need Thee! O bless me now, my Saviour, I come to Thee. I need Thee ev'ry hour; stay Thou nearby; temptations lose their pow'r when Thou art nigh. I need Thee ev'ry hour; in joy or pain; come quickly and abide, or life is vain. I need Thee ev'ry hour; teach me Thy will, and Thy rich promises in me fulfill.
