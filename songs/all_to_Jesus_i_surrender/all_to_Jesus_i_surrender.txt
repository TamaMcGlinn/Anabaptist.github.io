All to Jesus I surrender, all to Him I freely give; I will ever love and trust Him, in His presence daily live. I surrender all, I surrender all. All to Thee, my blessed Saviour, I surrender all. All to Jesus I surrender, humbly at His feet I bow, worldly pleasures all forsaken, take me Jesus, take me now. All to Jesus I surrender, make me Saviour, wholly Thine; may Thy Holy Spirit fill me, may I know Thy pow'r divine. All to Jesus I surrender, Lord, I give myself to Thee; fill me with Thy love and power, let Thy blessing fall on me.
