There's a land that is fairer than day, and by faith we can see it afar; for the Father waits over the way, to prepare us a dwelling place there. In the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful shore; in the sweet by and by, we shall meet on that beatiful shore. We shall sing on that beautifful shore the melodious songs of the blest, and our spirits shall sorrow no more, not a sigh for the blessing of rest. To our bountiful Father above, we will offer the tribute of praise for the glorious gift of His love, and the blessings that hallow our days.
