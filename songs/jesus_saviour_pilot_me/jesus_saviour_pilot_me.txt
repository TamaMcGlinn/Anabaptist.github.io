Jesus, Saviour, pilot me Over life's tempestuous sea; Unknown waves before me roll, hiding rock and treach'rous shoal. Chart and compass came from Thee: Jesus, Saviour, pilot me. As a mother stills her child, Thou canst hush the ocean wild; boist'rous waves obey Thy will when Thou say'st to them "Be still!" Wond'rous Sov'reign of the sea, Jesus, Saviour, pilot me. When at last I near the shore, and the fearful breakers roar 'twixt me and the peaceful rest, then while leaning on Thy breast, may I hear Thee say to me, "Fear not, I will pilot thee."
