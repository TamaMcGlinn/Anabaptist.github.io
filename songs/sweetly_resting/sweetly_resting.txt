In the rifted Rock I'm resting; safely sheltered I abide; there no foes nor storms molest me, while within the cleft I hide. Now I'm resting, sweetly resting, in the cleft once made for me; Jesus, blessed Rock of Ages, I will hide myself in Thee. Long pursued by sin and Satan, weary, sad, I longed for rest; then I found this heav'nly shelter, opened in my Saviour's breast. Peace, which passeth understanding, joy the world can never give, now in Jesus I am finding: In His smiles of love I live. In the rifted Rock I'll hide me till the storms of life are past, all secure in this blest refuge, heeding not the fiercest blast.
