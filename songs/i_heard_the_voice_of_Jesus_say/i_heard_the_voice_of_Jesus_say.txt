I heard the voice of Jesus say, "Come unto Me and rest; Lay down, thou weary one, lay down thy head upon My breast!" I came to Jesus as I was, weary and worn and sad; I found in Him a resting place, and He has made me glad. I heard the voice of Jesus say, "Behold, I freely give the living water, thirsty one, stoop down and drink and live!" I came to Jesus, and I drank of that livegiving stream: My thirst was quenched, my soul revived, and now I live in Him. I heard the voice of Jesus say, "I am this dark world's Light; look unto Me, thy morn shall rise and all thy day be bright!" I looked to Jesus, and I found in Him my Star, my Sun; and in that light of life I'll walk till all my journey's done.
