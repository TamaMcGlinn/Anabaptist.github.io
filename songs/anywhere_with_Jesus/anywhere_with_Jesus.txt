Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go, anywhere He leads me in this world below; anywhere without Him, dearest joys would fade, anywhere with Jesus I am not afraid. Anywhere! Anywhere! Fear I cannot know; Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go. Anywhere with Jesus I am not alone, other friends may fail me, He is still my own: though His hand may lead me over drearest ways, anywhere with Jesus is a house of praise. Anywhere with Jesus I can go to sleep, when the darkling shadows round about me creep: knowing I shall waken, never more to roam, anywhere with Jesus will be home, sweet home.
