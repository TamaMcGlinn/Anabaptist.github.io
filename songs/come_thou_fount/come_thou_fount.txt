Come, Thou fount of ev'ry blessing, tune my heart to sing Thy grace; streams of mercy, never ceasing, call for songs of loudest praise. Teach me some melodious sonnet, sung by flaming tongues above; praise the mount! I'm fixed upon it, mount of Thy redeeming love. Here I raise my Ebenezer; hither by Thy help I'm come; and I hope, by Thy good pleasure, safely to arrive at home. Jesus sought me when a stranger, wand'ring from the fold of God: He, to rescue me from danger, interposed His precious blood. O to grace how great a debtor daily I'm constrained to be; let that grace, Lord, like a fetter, bind my wand'ring heart to Thee. Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it; prone to leave the God I love! here's my heart, O, take and seal it, seal it for Thy courts above.
