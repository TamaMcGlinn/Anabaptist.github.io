'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus, just to take Him at His Word; just to rest upon His promise; just to know, "Thus saith the Lord." Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him; how I've proved Him o'ver and o'ver. Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus! O for grace to trust Him more. O, how sweet to trust in Jesus, just to trust His cleansing blood; just in simple faith to plunge me 'neath the healing, cleansing flood. Yes, 'tÂ is sweet to trust in Jesus, just from sin and self to cease; just from Jesus simply taking life, and rest, and joy, and peace. I'm so glad I learned to trust thee, precious Jesus, Saviour, Friend; and I know that Thou art with me, wilt be with me to the end.
