Sweet hour of pray'r! Sweet hour of pray'r! That calls me from a world of care, and bids me at my Father's throne make all my wants and wishes known; in seasons of distress and grief, my soul has often found relief; And oft escaped the tempter's snare by thy return, sweet hour of pray'r. Sweet hour of pray'r! Sweet hour of pray'r! Thy wings shall my petition bear to Him whose truth and faithfulness engage the waiting soul to bless; and since He bids me seek His face, believe His Word and trust His grace, I'll cast on Him my ev'ry care, and wait for thee sweet hour of pray'r. Sweet hour of pray'r! Sweet hour of pray'r! May I thy consolation share; till, from Mount Pisgah's lofty height, I view my home, and take my flight; this robe of flesh I'll drop, and rise to seize the everlasting prize; and shout, while passing through the air, farewell, farewell, sweet hour of pray'r.
