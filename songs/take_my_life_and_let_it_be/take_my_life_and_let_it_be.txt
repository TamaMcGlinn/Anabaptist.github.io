Take my life, and let it be consecrated, Lord to Thee: take my moments and my days, let them flow in ceaseless praise. Take my feet, and let them be swift and beautiful for Thee; take my voice, and let me sing always, only for my King. Take my silver and my gold; not a mite would I withhold; take my intellect, and use ev'ry power as Thou choose. Take my will and make it Thine, it shall be no longer mine; take my heart, it is Thine own, it shall be Thy royal throne. Take my love; my Lord, I pour at Thy feet its treasurestore; take myself and I will be ever, only, all for Thee.
