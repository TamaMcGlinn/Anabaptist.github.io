Encamped along the hills of light, ye Christian soldiers, rise, and press the battle ere the night shall veil the glowing skies Against the foe in vales below let all our strength be hurled; Faith is the victory, we know, that overcomes the world. Faith is the victory! Faith is the victory! Oh, glorious victory, that overcomes the world. His banner over us is love, our sword the Word of God; We tread the road the saints above with shouts of triumph trod. By faith, they like a whirlwind's breath, swept on o'er ev'ry field. The faith by which they conquer'd death is still our shining shield. Faith Faith On ev'ry hand the foe we find drawn up in dread array; Let tents of ease be left behind, and- onward to the fray. Salvation's helmet on each head, with truth all girt about, the earth shall tremble 'neith our tread, and echo with our shout. To him that overcomes the foe, white raiment shall be giv'n; Before the angels he shall know His name confessed in heav'n. Then onward from the hills of light, our hearts with love aflame; We'll vanquish all the hosts of night, in Jesus' conqu'ring name.
