My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness; I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but wholly lean on Jesus' name. On Christ the solid Rock, I stand: all other ground is sinking sand, all other ground is sinking sand. When darkness seems to veil His face, I rest on His unchanging grace; In ev'ry high and stormy gale my anchor holds within the veil. His oath, His covenant and blood support me in the whelming flood; When all around my soul gives way, He then is all my hope and stay. When He shall come with trumpet sound, O, may I then in Him be found, clad in His righteousness alone, faultless to stand before the throne.
