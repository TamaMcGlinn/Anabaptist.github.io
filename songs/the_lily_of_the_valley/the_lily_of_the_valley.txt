I have found a friend in Jesus, He's ev'rything to me, He's the fairest in ten thousand to my soul; The lily of the valley, in Him alone I see, all I need to cleanse and make me fully whole. In sorrow He's my comfort, in trouble He's my stay, He tells me ev'ry care on Him to roll. The lily of the valley, in Him alone I see, all I need to cleanse and make me fully whole. Yes, He all my griefs has taken, and all my sorrows borne; in temptation He's my strong and mighty tow'r; I all for Him forsaken, and all my idols torn from my heart and now He keeps me by His pow'r. Tho' all the world forsake me, and Satan tempt me sore, through Jesus I will safely reach the goal. He will never, never leave me, nor yet forsake me here, while I live by faith and do His blessed will; A wall of fire about me, I've nothing now to fear, with His manna He my hungry soul will fill. Then sweeping up to glory to see His blessed face, where rivers of delight shall ever roll.
