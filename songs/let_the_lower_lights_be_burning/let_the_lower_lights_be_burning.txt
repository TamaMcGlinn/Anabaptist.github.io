Brightly beams our Father's mercy from His lighthouse evermore, but to us He gives the keeping of the lights along the shore. Let the lower lights be burning! Send a gleam across the wave! Some poor fainting struggling seaman you may rescue, you may save. Dark the night of sin has settled, loud the angry billows roar; eager eyes are watching, longing, for the lights along the shore. Trim your feeble lamp, my brother: Some poor sailor tempesttossed, trying now to make the harbour, in the darkness may be lost.
