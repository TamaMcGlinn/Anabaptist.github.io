O land of rest, for thee I sigh! When will the moment come When shall I lay my armour by, and dwell with Christ at home? We'll work till Jesus comes, we'll work till Jesus comes, we'll work till Jesus comes, and we'll be gathered home. No tranquil joyrs on earth I know, no peaceful shelt'ring dome; this world's a wilderness of woe; this world is not my home. To Jesus Christ I sought for rest; He bade me cease to roam, and fly for succor to His breast, and He'd conduct me home. I would at once have quit this place, where foes in fury roam, but, ah! my passport was not sealed, I could not yet go home. Weary of wand'ring round and round this vale of sin and gloom, I long to leave th'unhallowed ground, and dwell with Christ at home.
