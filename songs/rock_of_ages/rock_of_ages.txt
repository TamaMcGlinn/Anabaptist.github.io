Rock of ages, cleft for me, let me hide myself in Thee, let the water and the blood, from Thy riven side which flowed, be of sin the double cure; cleanse me from its guilt and pow'r. Not the labor of my hands can fulfill the law's demands; could my zeal no respite know, could my tears forever flow, all for sin could not atone, Thou must save, and thou alone. Nothing in my hand I bring, simply to Thy cross I cling; naked come to Thee for dress; helpless look to Thee for grace, foul I to the fountain fly, wash me Saviour or I die. While I draw this fleeting breath, when my heartstrings break in death, when I soar to worlds unknown, see Thee on Thy judgment throne, Rock of Ages, cleft for me, let me hide myself in Thee.
